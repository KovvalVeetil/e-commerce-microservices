## Integration Testing:

### Steps to Test the Microservices:

Run Each Microservice: Ensure that each microservice (User, Product, Order, Payment, Shipping, Notification) is running on its designated port.

Integration Test Scripts: Write scripts that simulate the complete workflow, making HTTP requests to each service and verifying the responses. You can use tools like curl, Postman, or a Python script with the requests library


Docker Compose: Use Docker Compose to run all microservices in isolated containers and handle networking between them.
